###Vigenere Cipher
1. A program to learn string manipulation from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/learn-list-comprehension-by-building-a-vigenere-cipher/step-1)
2. Takes a string and a key and returns a string of the encrypted text or vice versa
3. Cipher is currently buggy and will play with it to allow user input as well as encryption/decryption correctly in both directions (04.12.2024)

###Convert to Snake Case
1. A conversion program to learn about lists from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/learn-list-comprehension-by-building-a-case-converter-program/step-1)
2. Takes a string of PascalCase or camelCase and converts it to snake_case and adds it to the list
3. Modified main() and lines 28-32 to ask for user input, as well as introduce the program and print out examples of the program's output
4. Commented out lines 2-10 are the long version of what lines 14-18 do
5. Added a while loop to keep asking for user input, as well as a way to exit the program
